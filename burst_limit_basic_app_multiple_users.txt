So this is the test for the bust capacity hitting. So we have three user thread groups, so representing one user each. Now we have set the max capacity for bust capacity as 150. And we can see that for after the first request, the bust tokens used are 61. And after the second, it is 122 for the dummy user one. And after the third, it reached 183, which is above 150. So even though it has not yet hit the max tokens limit, but because the burst window is 60 seconds within which it has reached the 183 tokens, which is above the burst capacity. So until the burst capacity resets after the given period of 60 seconds window, it wouldn't allow the further request. So the rest of the three requests which are sent after this are all denied. Similarly, for the user two and user three also, first three requests are allowed. And after three requests, both of them also have independently reached their bust capacity, crossed their bust capacity, and hence the rest of the requests which are coming after this are denied.Yeah, now we can see this file like in comparison to that. So we have only nine requests which are properly accepted and completed. And we can see after starting from the 11th row like which is the 10th request. So they are all denied and they are coming as too many requests. So this is because of the burst capacity being hit for all the users and it is not allowing the further request.
