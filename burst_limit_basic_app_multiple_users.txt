So this is a test case scenario for multiple users hitting their burst capacity independently. So right now our burst capacity is set for 150 and if we see the current load or the request that I am sending approximately consumes around 50 tokens to 65 tokens approximately. So according to that logic after 3 requests it should cross the 150 tokens. So from here also we can see the first if we take dummy user 2. For the first request it has consumed around 61 tokens but it has not updated. In the dummy user 2 second request also it is still logged as 61 only. So for the dummy user 2 like we can see that is logged as 126. So after this update for the next request for the user request 4 that time it would have crossed 150 and it is denying the request 4. So 3 requests are successfully getting over and we are getting the burst capacity hit.
