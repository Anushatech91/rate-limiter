We ran a test to check how the requests per minute (RPM) limits behave for different app tiers. Each user was linked to a different app:

User 1 → Basic app (200 tokens)

User 2 → Standard app (1000 tokens)

User 3 → Premium app (2000 tokens)

The rule is that every app can only make 6 requests per minute.

In our test, we sent 8 requests per user at the same time. What we saw was:

For each user, the first 6 requests went through.

The extra requests after that were blocked with a “Too Many Requests” response.

For example, User 1’s 7th and 8th requests failed, and User 3’s 5th and 8th requests failed.

So basically, even though different users had different token limits, the system correctly enforced the RPM cap of 6 requests for each user separately.
